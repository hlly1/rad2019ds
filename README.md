# Rapid Application Development Assignment

This is an assignment developed by Dan Wang and Hongyang Lyu.

## Client Request

This assignment is developed based on the following fictitious message from the school admin
team.

*Dear Andy*
*Our school is thinking of building a course management website to help staff organize existing courses and propose*
*new courses. RAD students may be able to help as everyone is saying they know how to quickly build a good online*
*application from scratch.*
*We donâ€™t have anything formal yet. Our admin team of course want a site, which is easy to use and has good look-nfeel.*
*People with a proper RMIT email address should be able to register to be a user. Do you think we should only*
*allow registered users to create, update and remove course content? Viewing the courses should not be a*
*problem. Mmm... it would be nice that every course has a picture. Is that possible to thumb-up thumb-down a*
*course?*
*Can your team put something together first, so I can show to my team for feedback and discussion?*
*Thank you and talk soon.*

Based on the above email, your task is to build a quick prototype. The following screenshots
are indicative. You can make necessary adjustment to improve the design. Your application
can have different look-n-feel, but should maintain at least the same quality, e.g. using
Bootstrap.
